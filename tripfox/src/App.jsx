Building the Login/Signup System for Tripfox:
Here's a breakdown of creating the initial three-tier login/signup system for your Tripfox Railway Reservation System:
<hr />
<br />
1. User Interface (Frontend):
<br />

Develop separate login/signup forms for each user category:
<span>1. User Interface (Frontend):</span>
<br  />
 Form fields for username/email, password, and optional information like name, phone number, etc.
Agent: Similar to user, with additional fields for agent ID (provided by the company) and potentially a security code for verification.
Customer Care: Separate login form with username/email and password. Consider implementing two-factor authentication (2FA) for an added layer of security.
<br />
2. User Authentication (Backend):

Implement user authentication using Node.js and Express.js for the backend:
Store user information securely in a database like MongoDB. Hash and salt passwords before storing them in the database.
During login, validate user credentials against the stored information.
Issue JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) upon successful login for secure session management. These tokens will be used to identify and authorize users in subsequent requests.
<br />
3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

Implement RBAC to restrict access based on 
<br />
user roles:
User/Customer: Can search trains, book tickets, manage their bookings (if permitted), and view PNR status.
Agent: Can perform all user actions, additionally having access to functionalities like booking tickets for others (based on specific permissions) and potentially generating reports.
Customer Care: Full access to user and agent functionalities, including modifying reservations, issuing refunds (if applicable), and managing user accounts.
<br />
4. Technology Stack:

Utilize React.js for building the responsive user interface for login/signup forms.
Leverage Node.js and Express.js for backend development, including user authentication, API communication, and data management.
Integrate with MongoDB for storing user information and session data securely.
Consider using libraries like bcryptjs for password hashing andjsonwebtoken for JWT implementation.
<br />
5. Additional Considerations:

Implement functionalities for password reset and account recovery.
Secure user sessions by implementing proper session management techniques and ensuring secure communication channels using HTTPS.
Design the system to be scalable and adaptable to future functionalities.
Note: This is a high-level overview. The actual implementation will involve writing code, handling specific functionalities, and ensuring security best practices are followed. It is recommended to consult with experienced developers and security professionals for a robust and secure implementation.
